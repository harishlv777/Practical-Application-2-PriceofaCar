# Practical-Application-2
# What drives the price of a Car?

# Overview

This is a practical application problem to identify factors that help drive the price of a used car. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure the speed of processing. Goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of analysis, clear recommendations are provided to used car dealerships with insights to what consumers value in a used car.

To analyze the factors that influence car prices and provide recommendations to a used car dealership, we'll follow the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. This approach will help us systematically address the problem and derive valuable insights.

# Business Understanding

The primary objective of this "Price of a car" practical application is to identify the factors that make a car more or less expensive in the used car market, and develop a model to help car dealers understand what factors consumers value in a used car. This understanding will help the dealership make informed decisions about inventory acquisition and pricing strategies.

# Data Preparation
Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and key features. Then, cleaned and prepared the data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identified factors influencing used car prices.

Cleaning the data (handling missing values, removing duplicates)
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for make and model)
Normalizing numerical variables
Feature engineering (e.g., creating age variable from year of manufacture)
